Background}}{Topic Background}}\label{topic-background}}

Each of our team members originally selected a few datasets that we
compared as a group. Our group decided to explore a dataset Ana found
related to the topic of racial and ethnic diversity at two-year and
four-year colleges and universities in the United States. We initally
thought to compare diversity at two-year community colleges versus
4-year schools and also were curious about the variations in diversity
between the two that could be found comparatively across the country.

As we were exploring the dataset we identified a number of named
colleges and universities that are known as ``for-profit'' institutions.
Some of these institutions have been the subject of recent lawsuits
regarding predatory (Halperin, 2020; Legal Services Center, 2020;
Redman, 2020). The high number of current lawsuits regarding for-profit
colleges' predatory behaviors are a result of the actions of current
Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. In 2019, DeVos ``repealed an Obama-era
regulation that sought to crack down on for-profit colleges and
universities that produced graduates with no meaningful job prospects
and mountains of student debt they could not hope to repay'' (Green,
2019. para. 1). Another action that DeVos took was to deny debt
forgiveness to students who had been prey to for-profit predatory
educational institutions (Lobosco, 2019; Turner, 2019). We were aware of
past and recent news articles describing the marketing strategies of
these colleges that were aimed at students of color, low-income
students, immigrant communities and students who are first in their
family to go to college (Bonadies et al.~2018; Conti, 2019; Voorhees,
2019). Previous studies have found that loan debt is higher for students
who have attended For-Profit institutions, which disproportionately
affects students of color.

\end{figure}

(Body, 2019)

Despite their high cost, For-profit institutions have a lower graduation
rate and employment rate than non-profit institutions.

We will examine our dataset and explore possible consistencies and/or
inconsistencies with these previous reports.

\hypertarget{initial-questions}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Initial
Questions}}{Initial Questions}}\label{initial-questions}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  How do racial and ethnic demographics vary between not-for-profit
  institutions and for-profit colleges in our dataset?
\item
  In our dataset, do the For-Profit Institutions have a higher
  proportion of students of color than other community colleges and
  four-year colleges, thus providing support to the argument that
  For-Profit colleges target students of color for enrollment?
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{definitions}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Definitions}:}{Definitions:}}\label{definitions}}

\textbf{For-Profit Institutions}: For-profit institutions are defined by
the way that ``revenue earned by the school is invested''. For-profit
colleges have investors who want to make a profit. Their operations
management is determined in part on maximizing the return profit for
investors. ``Money earned by the shcool may be used to pay out investors
and award boneuses to executives, as well as sustain the operation's
profitability through aggressive marketing and recruitment strategies''
(TBS Staff, 2019, para. 8)

\textbf{Not-for Profit Institutions}: Non-profit colleges can be either
public or private. Regardless of whether the school is public or
private, non-profit colleges must ``reinvest the money earned through
enrollment into the educational mission'' (TBS Staff, 2019, para. 8).

Our dataset did not include information on whether colleges were
for-profit.

In order to determine which of the schools on our list were for-profit
institutions, we decided to find a website with a list of for-profit
institutions, scrape the data from that website, to create a second
dataset with a list of for profit schools.

The webscraping exercise produced a list of over 1,000 schools. We
decided to take a random sample of n=35 schools on that list, which also
appeared in our dataset. We selected 35 schools so that we would comply
with the Central Limit Theorem. The result of the randomization we ran
on the webscraped data is below. Each of us compared a portion of the
list with our dataset to ensure that all of our selections were present
on both lists. We ran multiple randomizations until we had a consistent
list with 35 schools appearing on both datasets. Some of the randomly
chosen schools had multiple locations, as is shown in the example set of
schools below. The final list of schools was geographically diverse.

The dataset we chose to work with produced diversity counts at
institutions of higher learning in the United States. The datset was
retrieved from Kaggle, available here:
\url{https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/college-tuition-diversity-and-pay?select=diversity_school.csv}

The entire dataset is composed of five separate .csv files addressing
school diversity, historical tuition rates, salary protential, the cost
of tuition in 2016 and the income of students compared to tuition. We
utilized the school diversity file only.

There were numerous ``tidying'' exercises that we undertook to clean our
data and make the webscraping dataset and the diversity dataset
comparable. Our tidying exercises included, but were not limited to,
creating the following: 1. a new column calculating the percent of
students in attendance based on race and ethnicity 2. a new binary
column identifying the selected for-profit and not-for-profit schools
represented by ``1'' and ``0'' respectively.\\
3. two new datasets: one for our randomly selected for-profit schools
and one for our randomly selected not-for-profit schools.

\subsubsection{Merging and Summarizing the Data for Schools with
Multiple
Locations}\label{merging-and-summarizing-the-data-for-schools-with-multiple-locations}}

All of the schools with multiple locations have a single name now,
however, they still are separated by rows. We would like to combine all
of the statistic for each ``category'' for all of the locations into one
summarized row. We have not yet determined how to accomplish this. For
example in the following image you can see four locations for the
University of Houston.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{Univ_of_Houston} \caption{**University of Houston Example**}\label{fig:pressure1}
\end{figure}

What we would like to do is combine each of the four into one set of 7
lines with the averages calculated for each category's enrollment and
enrollment percentage.

For consistency of methodology we decided to select 35 schools from the
not-for-profit educational institutions to compare to the 35 randomly
selected for-profit schools. The final list of randomly selected
not-for-profit schools was also geographically diverse.

successfully create a new column with ``1'' for the identified

As the graphs above illustrate, our data verifies that indeed there are
a higher proportion of students of color at for-profit colleges than at
non-profit colleges. White Students (shown in pink in the above plots)
have much greater attendance at non-profit colleges. These findings
provide support for the argument that there are higher numbers of
enrollment of students of color at for-profit colleges. One possible
explanation could be targeted marketing campaigns by for-profit colleges
to students of color. Further research is required.

Given the well-documented high cost of for-profit education, the
exorbitant student debt incurred at these schools, the lower rates of
employment upon graduation and the low levels of satisfaction with
educational quality from previous students, all potential students
should think twice before enrolling in for-profit colleges. This is
particularly true for students of color who may be identified by
for-profit colleges as susceptible to predatory exploitative practices
that will provide additional profits to the college's shareholders
without making good on their promise to provide a marketable, quality
education. The predatory actions of for-profit colleges contribute to
our nation's growing economic divide between the haves and the have nots
and perpetuates the unequal education system we have today. Fortunately,
there are many people and organizations working to end these predatory
practices, but in the meantime while they continue to exist, we must
inform one another about the importance of obtaining a quality education
at not-for-profit institutions, like Montgomery College.

The following is a list of more detailed analysis that could be done
with this dataset:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Comparing diversity of for-profit and not-for-profit schools in the
  same geographic regions utilizing local racial demographics.
\item
  Comparing community colleges, to four-year-institutions, to for-profit
  institutions
\item
  Comparing the tuition rates, salary potential and overall profits
  received from community colleges, four-year institutions and
  for-profit institutions.
\item
  A longitudinal study could be conducted to see if there have been
  changes in the demographic makeup of for-profit colleges in the time
  before the Obama-era regulations, the lack of regulation during the
  DeVos era and the patterns that emerge after the predatory lending
  lawsuits and any resulting legislation.
